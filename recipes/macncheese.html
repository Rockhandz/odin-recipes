    <li>500g Cooked shredded chicken</li>
    <li>500g Macaroni Pasta</li>
    <li>40g Butter</li>
    <li>40g Plain Flour</li>
    <li>500g Cheese (Freshly Grated, dont use pre grated)</li>
    <li>500ml Semi-Skimmed Milk</li>
    <li>1tsp Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>100ml Franks Buffalo Hot Sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recipe</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First bring a pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta as per the packets instructions</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta and save about 100mls of the pasta water (this will come in handy later when adding the sauce)</li>
    <li>Pre-Heat your oven to 170 degrees Celsius </li>
    <li>Add the butter to a pan on a low heat and melt completely</li>
    <li>Add the flour to the butter and stir thoroughly until combined</li>
    <li>Once combined allow to cook for about 90 seconds</li>
    <li>Now slowly begin to add the milk in small amounts stirring constantly (it is important to go slow to ensure a smooth sauce)</li>
    <li>Once all the milk is added continue to stir and add in the Dijon Mustard and season with Salt and Pepper</li>
    <li>Now add 400g of your cheese in 100g (.Approx) increments stirring all the time until fully melted</li>
    <li>Take the sauce off the heat</li>
    <li>Add the pasta back into the pasta cooking pot and add a couple of table spoons of the pasta water, this should help break up any stuck pieces</li>
    <li>Add the chicken and sauce to the pasta and stir in (at this point also add the Buffalo sauce if you like it Hot!!!)</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into a baking dish and sprinkle over the remaining cheese</li> 
    <li>Place into the oven for 20 mins or until cheese on top is golden</li>
    <li>Enjoy!!!</li>
  </ol>
